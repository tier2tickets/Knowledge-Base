Tier2Forms
========================

Tier2Forms is a special integration we designed to allow user-defined Google Forms to submit additional information into existing tickets
in your ticket system. Once a Google Form is connected to the Tier2Forms system, then any time that form is submitted, the data is posted
to our API where we append it as a private note onto the existing ticket. Using the Tier2Assist automations, you can provide the Google Form
to your end-user at the time of ticket creation to prompt for more details from the end-user.

Tier2Forms Privacy Policy
---------------------------

What data is collected.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The data collected by the Tier2Forms integration is only the data which is submitted in the Google Form itself. If you wish to exclude data from
collection, simply do not connect a Google Form which collects that data with the Tier2Forms integration.


How data is being collected.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The data is collected at the time that the Google Form is submitted by the end-user of the form itself. At the moment of submission of the form,
the entire contents of the form and all corresponding responses are passed to our web API and stored in our database.


What we are doing with the data.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The data is used solely to append additional information to a support ticket previously created by the form user, or to create a new support
ticket if a previous support ticket cannot be located. The data is stored for as long as the ticket is in our system. 
We will never sell, rent or share information submitted via Tier2Forms with a 3rd party, especially your email addresses and phone numbers,
without your express permission, unless required by law.

How customers can control their data.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In accordance with GDPR regulations, other similar regulations, and good-faith, upon request by the owner of such data
by email to support@helpdeskbuttons.com, we will purge private/identifiable data from our systems within 30 days.

 
How we protect the data.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Personal data shall be subject to additional safeguards to ensure this data is processed securely. For example, we ensure data is encrypted when in
transit and storage inside of our platform. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your
data transmitted via third parties; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures
and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access. When possible, encryption is used, both in transit and storage. Access controls
within the organization limit who may access information.
