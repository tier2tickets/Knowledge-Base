Technician Access
====================

From an Integrated PSA
-----------------------

A high entropy randomized URL is generated for each ticket submission via Tier 2 Tickets™. This link is added to the ticket (as an internal/private/hidden note if possible.) A tech with access to the ticket system can use that link to get to the ticket so long as they are allowed to by an administrator on our website backend.

Website Backend
----------------

Viewing a ticket report generated via Tier 2 Tickets™ requires that you have the URL for that ticket, access via the Gatekeeper, and are signed into the `Tier 2 Tickets™ backend website <https://account.helpdeskbuttons.com/login.php>`_ under an account that has permission to view ticket reports.

2FA
----

Of course our site is protected with Multi-Factor Authentication using the same `TOTP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_algorithm>`_ standard everything else does. It will work with any Multi-Factor App or generator you want to use.

To set up 2FA 
++++++++++++++
1. Enable 2FA on the main Account through the `Account Administration Page<https://account.helpdeskbuttons.com/account_info>`_.
2. Create `Subaccounts <https://account.helpdeskbuttons.com/subaccounts>`_ for each user and securely deliver the generated OTP to each user.
3. Users will then set up their own 2FA via QR Code upon signing in with provided OTP in step 2.
