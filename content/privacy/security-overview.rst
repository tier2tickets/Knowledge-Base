Security and Compliance
=========================

Tier 2 Ticketsâ„¢ was built with data security in mind at each step of the ticket creation process, from initiation and transfer, to storage and access. We are proud of the product we have created, wrapped up in industry-leading security; going beyond the standard 2-factor authentication, auditing, and captchas, we have the option to host everything on a customer-controlled Amazon S3, IP filtering, and much more.
