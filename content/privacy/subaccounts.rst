Sub-accounts
============

The Sub-account option is under the Administraton tab. Once you add a new user to the list, they will receive an email notification with a link to set their password. If you have two factor authentication enabled on the account (as you should), then this will be enforced on all of the sub-accounts as well. 
Each account, the main and all sub-accounts will have thier own 2FA code.
