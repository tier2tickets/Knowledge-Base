Cloud Compliance Package Set-up
===============================

Thank you for purchasing the Cloud Compliance package! Here's how to initiate the set-up:
--------------

Please find the steps below and let us know if you have any questions! Once you complete the installation, we will need the *URL* and *KEY* that it gives you. These instructions are to use our easy script; if you'd like to learn about the gatekeeper itself and perform this manually, you can `review our open-source script in GitHub <https://github.com/tier2tickets/s3_gatekeeper>`_. 

Please note: Before we sign a BAA with you, we require that your Helpdesk Buttons/Tier2Tickets account has `2FA enabled <https://docs.tier2tickets.com/content/privacy/to-your-techs/#fa>`_. 

1) Register for AWS account
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
First, you will need to `register for an Amazon Web Services account <https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start>`_.

2) Obtain Access Key/ID
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
Once you have an account, you get the key/ID from the `Security Credentials page <https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#security_credential>`_ under the Access Keys tab.

3) Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Open a PowerShell window (not a command prompt window).

Paste the following command into the window:
::

	iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://xaq.io/g?%7B0%7D' -f (Get-Random))) 

Press enter and follow the prompts.


Next Steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Please provide our team your URL and Key using `privnote <https://privnote.com/>`_ or a secure method of information transfer of your preference. You can send this to `support@tier2.tech <mailto:support@tier2.tech?subject=Cloud_Compliance_Keys>`_. `support@tier2.tech <mailto:support@tier2.tech?subject="Cloud Compliance Keys">`_ `support@tier2.tech <mailto:support@tier2.tech?subject='Cloud Compliance Keys'>`_

Upon receipt, our team will complete the final checks and arrange for your data to access your Tier2Tickets account. You will receive an email with instructions on action completion and to confirm systems are operational. 

Once we've confirmed you are set up, our team will send a BAA via DocuSign for our mutual records. Again, before this happens, you must `enable 2FA on your Helpdesk Buttons/Tier2Tickets account <https://docs.tier2tickets.com/content/privacy/to-your-techs/#fa>`_.

For your security, you should also sign a BAA with Amazon, which you can do `following these video instructions <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcU4c5REkTI>`_.
