IP Login Whitelists
==========================

The IP Login Whitelists page is a simple yet powerful security tool.

IP Whitelisting allows you to restrict access to the Helpdesk Button portal. You can whitelist by country, eg: US, GB, CA, AU, NL, NZ, IE, Internet Service Provider, eg: AT&T, Comcast, or individual IPs, eg: 98.188.247.34, 8.8.4.4.

Each whitelist is separate, so you can do things like: allow all US addresses, a specific ISP from the UK, and one IP from Ghana. 

The check box to Block Anonymous IPs will deny connections from anonymous sources, such as Cloud Based computing, VPNs, and anything that passes through a service like `Tor <https://www.torproject.org/>`_.
