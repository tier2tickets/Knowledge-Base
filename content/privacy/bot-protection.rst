Bot Protection (reCaptcha)
===========================

Another type of protection, that is much more recognizable but deserves a mention, is reCaptcha. reCaptcha is all over the web, and for a good reason, it works. Most sites are using it for things like stopping forum spam, but it prevents other malicious bots and brute-force password attacks extremely well. Something that users of our site probably have not noticed though is that we use reCaptcha all over the place and you never see it.

This is because reCaptcha offers an `invisible option <https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/invisible>`_, which stays completely out of the way unless there is reasonable suspicion that the user might not be human, then it springs into action asking you to click stop signs and traffic lights. The only sign that it is there protecting your account is this little symbol at the bottom right of the page.
