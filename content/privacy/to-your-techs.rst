To Your Techs
==============

From an Integrated PSA
-----------------------

A high entropy randomized URL is generated for each ticket submission via Tier 2 Tickets™. This link is added to the ticket (as an internal/private/hidden note if possible.) A tech with access to the ticket system can use that link to get to the ticket so long as they are allowed to by an administrator on our website backend.

Website Backend
----------------

Viewing a ticket report generated via Tier 2 Tickets™ requires that you have the URL for that ticket, access via the Gatekeeper, and are signed into the `Tier 2 Tickets™ backend website <https://account.helpdeskbuttons.com/login.php>`_ under an account that has permission to view ticket reports.

2FA

Of course our site is protected with Multi-Factor Authentication using the same `TOTP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_algorithm>`_ standard everything else does. It will work with any Multi-Factor App or generator you want to use.
