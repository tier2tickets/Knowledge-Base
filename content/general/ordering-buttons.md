# Ordering your Helpdesk Buttons
While Tier2Tickets can be used with a hotkey or by clicking the shortcut icon on your user's desktop, pairing with a Helpdesk Button upgrades our service from a useful piece of software to a powerful method of branding and user-engagement.

You can purchase buttons with the Helpdesk Buttons logo or you can customize them with your logo and colors.   

## What to expect

For most orders of Helpdesk Buttons with our branding, we ship on Mondays and Thursdays so you can expect your buttons customized with a link to your unique software within a week.

For custom buttons, the process takes an average of 4-6 weeks, from the time we are able to send your artwork to our production partner.

Our print process for custom buttons is as follows:
- We work with you on setting up the artwork and providing a digital proof so you know what to expect and can make any changes you want to the art before we send to production.
- Our production team runs a first cap and sends a photograph of the first art for your approval.
- Upon approval, your buttons are manufactured, programmed, and shipped to us. We QA them on several points including click, the long press, and your account link.
- We repackage them and send to your doorstep!
