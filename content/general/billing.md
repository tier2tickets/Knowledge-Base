# How does billing work?

Your rate is based on your number of installations (displayed in the chart below).    When you install the software on a new computer PC, it will periodically check into our platform. You can see all the active software installations for which you are being billed on the device management page. To stop being billed for an endpoint, you should first uninstall the software from the computer, and then delete it from the device management page.

Please note: We bill in increments of 25 licenses, so if you're in need of 27 licenses, you'll automatically be billed for 50. If you're in need of 476 licenses, you will be prompted to order 500. To help manage your licenses, we do offer auto-trimming of endpoints that having checked in for over 90 days, which you can select with the checkbox on https://beta.helpdeskbuttons.com/backend.php
