# How does billing work?

During beta, you are billed $0.30 per active software installation per month. You are billed daily and it is removed from your escrow account. When you install the software on a new computer PC, it checks-in to report itself every time a user logs in. You can see all the active software installations for which you are being billed on the device management page. To stop being billed for an endpoint, you should first uninstall the software from the computer, and then delete it from the device management page.

If you uninstall the software, or decommission a PC and do not remove the computer from the device management page it's not a big deal, because the computer will be auto-removed if it fails to check in for 90 days.
