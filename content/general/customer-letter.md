# Customer Letter Example

Dear {Valued Customer},

Now, get help at the press of a button!

{Insert screenshot of the ways you've chosen to implement Helpdesk Buttons!}

In our continued commitment as your technical partner, we've made it easier than ever to put in a help request with us. While you can still call and email us, the easiest, fastest way for you to get help from your dedicated tech team is through the Helpdesk Button, on your {Desk, desktop, taskbar, Function Key F#}.

Helpdesk Buttons makes sure your requests are solved quickly, with your personal preferences and availability in mind. Putting a help request in to our service desk through this process enables us to get you back to your regularly scheduled day with fewer interruptions, specifically without requiring us to ask you a ton of technical questions that you may not have time or answers for.

When you {press, click} the button, all you have to do is follow the new friendly form process, which will ask that you give us a short sentence about what you need, choose a few of your preferences, and click submit. Helpdesk Buttons will do the rest of the work by generating a complete report that goes direcly to our support desk and tells our team exactly what's happening to your computer: old hardware alerts, weird software errors, slow network issues, connected printer queues, and so much more.

We hope that you will enjoy this new process and we look forward to continue providing you with {your tagline! the same speed, support, and smarts you've come to expect from our team.}

As always, reach out to us if you have any questions, or better yet, hit that Button!

Thank you for your continued partnership,

{MSP}
