# Customer Letter Example

Dear {Valued Customer},

Now, get help at the press of a button!

{Insert screenshot of the ways you've chosen to implement Helpdesk Buttons!}

In our continued commitment as your technical partner, we've made it easier than ever to put in a help request with us. While you can still call and email us, the easiest, fastest way for you to get help from your dedicated tech team is through the Helpdesk Button, on your {Desk, desktop, taskbar, Function Key F#}.

The Helpdesk Button tells your technician exactly what's happening to your computer: old hardware alerts, weird software errors, slow network issues, connected printer queues, and so much more. Now, you don't have to wait by the phone to give your technician more details about the problem you're experiencing, and you especially don't have to worry about perfectly explaining what is wrong: every time you press the button to get help, you are giving us everything we need to solve your problems, quickly and easily.

We look forward to continue providing you with {your tagline! the same speed, support, and smarts you've come to expect from our team.} As always, reach out to us if you have any questions, or better yet, hit that Button!

Thank you for your continued partnership,

{MSP}
