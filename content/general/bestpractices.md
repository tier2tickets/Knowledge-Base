# Best Practices For Client Adoption
Many users will start using the Helpdesk Buttons with no instruction at all. However,  you may have some users who are used to putting in tickets in certain ways. (or not at all) In order to maximize adoption and get the biggest benefit from the button software we recommend the following: 

## 1) Distribute the guide
Prior to or during setup distribute [The Guide](https://www.helpdeskbuttons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Introduction-to-HDB-20200311.pdf) to end users. This one page handout explains what it is and how to use it. You can also use the guide it in your Marketing bundle! (we actually include a fully functional button that we give out in [our MSP marketing binder](https://imgur.com/a/TSeuoLU) marketing binder)  Let them know that they can use the buttons to put in tickets even if their computer is offline. 



## 2) Change user shortcuts
 If you use a ticketing portal link on end user desktops, consider removing it.  You can specify your portal link and logo to show up on the first GUI page of the button software itself. This will encourage the end users to use the software to submit tickets while still retaining the ability to use your portal directly when it is most appropriate, such as billing or administrative lookups and will remove customer confusion as to which thing to use.  

## 3) Edit your email responder
If you accept tickets via e-mail currently, consider adding instructions to your autoresponder, our MSP uses the following:  “ Thank you we have received your request and your ticket has been created.  Did you know the fastest easiest way to submit tickets is via our Helpdesk Buttons?  This method gives us a lot of extra information we can use to solve your issue and is the best way for us to service you quickly.  “ 



## 4) Edit your phone messages
You also may consider adding a recording in your phone system to the same effect as above. Our is: “ Our first available technician will be with you shortly,  For the fastest service you can also submit a ticket via your helpdesk button or icon on your desktop computer, This gives our technicians a huge head start on your issues and is the fastest way to get them resolved."



## 5) Add to your RMM tray icon

Many RMM tools have their own system tray icon.  We find that very few of our end users have ever used it but a few select ones do.  if your RMM supports it we recommending adding an option to this menu for "submit a support ticket" that will launch the helpdesk button software.  We have guides available on how to do this for a few RMM's already in the deployment section of our knowledge base.   

## 6) Sign up for a white glove onboarding

We can just do all of this for you and a whole lot more if you want.  Talk to your account manager about a white glove onboarding.
