# Best Practices For Client Adoption

Many users will start using Helpdesk Buttons and Tier2Tickets easily with no instruction at all. However, you may have some users who are used to putting in tickets in certain ways like email, phone or text, or not at all! In order to encourage users of all ability levels to submit the perfect ticket, every time, our most successful partners have implements some combination of at least the first (if not all six!) of the following best practices as they deploy our software.

We offer specialty onboarding services to ensure a smooth launch. Email us at sales@tier2.tech if you'd like to talk to our Onboarding team.

## 1) Deploy to all of your endpoints as a reliable part of your process and workflows.

Tier2Tickets is a workflow improvement tool: you'll see big wins when it is a part of your standard process. Use Tier2Tickets as a tool for all of your clients, not just a select group of endpoints, and train your technicians to expect and review the report.

## 2) Make how to use Tier2Tickets easy and visually obvious.

Humans are visual! You'll get the best adoption by making your ticketing process through Tier2Tickets blatant and obvious. We offer several methods of triggering our software in addition to the desktop icon, and we recommend using some combination of the following to train your end users to launch Tier2Tickets:

- the [Helpdesk Button](https://www.helpdeskbuttons.com/), with your branding on it
- the pinned-to-taskbar icon, edited if you'd like with your brand, but make sure it says "HELP" very clearly!, and/or
- a [HELP decal](https://www.helpdeskbuttons.com/product/keyboard-decals/) on the keyboard hotkey of your choice.

You may also value providing an email or handout of our [The How-to Guide](https://www.helpdeskbuttons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Introduction-to-HDB-20200311.pdf) prior to -- or during -- deployment to end users. [In our Marketing Collateral section](https://docs.tier2tickets.com/content/marketing/collateral/), we also provide an editable version as an INDD file that you can customize with your logo and standard function key setting. This one-page handout explains what it is and how to use it. You can also use the guide it in your marketing bundle! (Our MSP sister company actually includes a fully functional button that they give out in their [MSP marketing binder](https://imgur.com/a/TSeuoLU)). Let your end users know that they can use the buttons to put in tickets even if their computer is offline.

## 2) Give them hands-on training, in the field or as a meeting/training session/Lunch and Learn.

Encourage user adoption by giving end users intentional practice using this new process, whether on the fly in the field, or during planned meetings/training sessions.

### i. In the Field

#### When users call in: Use Tier2Tickets for User Verification and immediate diagnostic collection.

When a user calls to submit a ticket or attempts to grab a technician in the hallway, train your techs to guide the user to trigger the Tier2Tickets software and walk them through the process. You will then have automatic documentation and diagnostics on the user's problem, and in the case of phone calls, it's a great way to affirm the user's identity and workstation with our [proprietary Human Factor verification](https://docs.tier2tickets.com/content/privacy/trust/).

#### When a technician is on-site

Have an on-site tech take a minute to walk each person through submitting a ticket and explain to your end users that doing this small action gives them the power to help resolve their problems faster.

### ii. Lunch and Learn

Host a Lunch and Learn to cover any office-specific conversations you needed to have anyway. Walk them through the ticket submission process, how to submit a ticket, and even show them _parts of_ the report so they understand how much they're helping themselves when they submit a ticket versus calling or emailing you.

## 3) Make tickets submitted via Tier2Tickets higher priority than tickets that come in through email and telephone.

### i. by Email

If you accept tickets via e-mail currently, consider adding instructions to your autoresponder. Our MSP uses the following:

**Subject:** We received your Normal Priority Ticket. </br>
**Message:** “Thank you, we have received your request and your normal-priority ticket has been created. _Do you have an urgent or high-priority request? For immediate diagnostics, triage, and dispatch, please submit a ticket via your Helpdesk Button._“

### ii. by Phone

You also may consider adding a recording in your phone system to the same effect as above. Our is: “Our first available technician will be with you shortly. For the fastest service, you can also submit a ticket via your Helpdesk Button or icon on your desktop computer. This gives our technicians a huge head start on your issues and is the fastest way to get them resolved."

## 4) Make Tier2Tickets/Helpdesk Buttons your end users' "one-stop-shop".

If you use a ticketing portal link on end user desktops, consider removing it. You can specify your portal link and logo to show up on the first GUI page of the Tier2Tickets software itself and you'll find this is a much cleaner workflow. Removing these shortcuts will encourage the end users to use the software to submit tickets while still retaining the ability to use your portal directly when it is most appropriate and this will remove customer confusion as to which link to use.

## 5) Add us to your RMM tray icon

Many RMM tools have their own system tray icon. We find that very few of our end users have ever used it, but a few select ones do. If your RMM supports it, we recommending adding an option to this menu for "submit a support ticket" that will launch the Tier2Tickets software. We have guides available on how to do this for a few RMM's already in the deployment section of our knowledge base.

We can just do all of this for you and a whole lot more if you want. Talk to your account manager about a Premium Whiteglove Onboarding.
