Known Issues
==========
Here is a running list of Known Issues regarding software, hardware, and process. If you're having a problem, please don't hesitate to email us at support@tier2.tech. We pride ourselves on fixing things quickly for our partners; however, as a small team, there are a few things that we have to put on a schedule. This list is intended to provide transparency and clarity as we work hard on continuing to provide a high-quality product for our partners.

Tier2Tickets API/Backend
>>>>>>>>>>>>

#. **T2T-API.1001:** Connectwise Manage Integration sometimes submits multiple duplicate tickets (1-2 typically, sometimes 5-10!). 
  * Work-Around: This is a direct result of the CWM API; let support know you are experiencing duplicated we can extend the timeout for our service to minimize impact.
  * Projected Solution/ETR: Async handling TBD


Tier2Tickets GUI
>>>>>>>>>>>>
#. **T2T-GUI.1001:** Allow for Multi-lingual translations (Localization)
  * Work-Around: For accounts needing a single non-english 90% of GUI content is fully customizable. For accounts requiring several languages, we will create a new T2T account for you and apply billing discounts as per your total endpoints. 
  * Projected Solution/ETR: To customize full multi-tenancy, T2T will first require a better RMM integration to capture and organize customers with granularity. Fully-customizable strings estimated 2022 Q3.

Helpdesk Buttons
>>>>>>>>>>>>
#. **HDB.1001:** Only connection is USB 2.0. Requests for 3.0 and Bluetooth Options.
  * Work-Around: Standardly, our partners use the Tier2Tickets launchkeys.  
  * Projected Solution/ETR: Currently these options are generally cost-prohibitive. We wanted Helpdesk Buttons to be affordable and profitable and decided to not pursue these options. However, for partners that have a big budget for this, we are open to talking about one-off orders: email us at sales@tier2.tech.
