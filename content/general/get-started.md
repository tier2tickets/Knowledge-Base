# Getting Started with Helpdesk Buttons
From the beginning, our goal was to make the start-up process for Helpdesk Buttons accessible to anyone who wants to try it. We didn't want any features or abilities stuck behind paywalls or shrouded in layers of minutae or smoke and mirrors. All you need to do is login, download, and install the custom Helpdesk Buttons software you've built on the devices you'd like to employ our software.

If you'd like more direction, here's how we envision it working for you:

##1) Install and test your software
**1. Login to your account.**
The first time you log in to your account, we create a basic version of your software as an MSI that you can download and test out right away with the email connector and Helpdesk Buttons branding active.
**2. Navigate to the Builds Page.**
Here's the link: https://beta.helpdeskbuttons.com/builds.php.
**3. Download and Install your Custom Software**
Check it out. Envision how much your customers will enjoy it. Set up your PSA integration and customize the text throughout the user form on the settings page: https://beta.helpdeskbuttons.com/settings.php. Add your custom branding and create another build. Download. Test. Customize. Rinse. Repeat.

##2) Order buttons
To order physical buttons, you can visit https://beta.helpdeskbuttons.com/buy.php. If you want custom buttons, we work with art you send us (we request a 2-color SVG) and we get that set up for print and production as well as preprogramming with a link to your most recent software build, which can be installed with a long (10s) button press. We also preprogram the Helpdesk Button-branded buttons with your build as well.

##3) Deploy to all of your endpoints remotely
We have a link to that aforementioned MSI as well as custom Powershell and Batch scripts for deploying on your builds page: https://beta.helpdeskbuttons.com/builds.php, and if you need assistance, we offer our welcome and service packages during which our development team can assist and complete all of this for you. These are also linked through the buy page, but you can visit the shop directly, here: https://cms.helpdeskbuttons.com/product-category/starter-pack/.

####A word on billing
We bill according to the number of devices that check in with our servers, so you don't have to worry with buying licenses, that's all managed automagically through our escrow system on the billing page: https://beta.helpdeskbuttons.com/billing.php.

##4) Enjoy your new user workflow through the flexibility and extensibility of Helpdesk Buttons!
We know that your business flow is going to differ from our hundreds of other clients, so we're constantly building out better methods for you to take the reins on what information is being collected and how close of an integration you'd like with your PSA. With each ticket submitted to you, you will receive the same excellent baseline of real-time diagnostics and annotated screenshots, but with our Custom Scripts and Advanced Integration options, you can better gather pertinent information, triage and process tickets before they've even hit your system.
