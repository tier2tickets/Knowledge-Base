# Getting Started with Helpdesk Buttons
From the beginning, our goal was to make the start-up process for Helpdesk Buttons accessible to anyone who wants to try it. It takes most people 15 minutes or less to configure and deploy their first batch of agents. We didn't want any features or abilities stuck behind paywalls or shrouded in smoke and mirrors. If something is unclear or seems inaccessible, it's probably because we just haven't written instructions down yet or maybe we forgot to. So let us know on the forums or by calling and we'll fix it.

All you need to do is log in to your account, download, and install the custom Helpdesk Buttons software you've built on the devices you'd like to employ our software.

If you'd like more direction, here's how we envision it working for you:

## 1) Install and test your software
1. **Login to your account.**
The first time you log in to your account, we create a basic version of your software as an MSI that you can download and test out right away with the email connector and Helpdesk Buttons branding active.
2. **Navigate to the Builds Page.**
Here's the link: [Builds Page](https://beta.helpdeskbuttons.com/builds.php).
3. **Download and Install your Custom Software**
Check it out. Envision how much your customers will enjoy it. Set up your PSA integration and customize the text throughout the user form on the settings page: [Settings Page](https://beta.helpdeskbuttons.com/settings.php). Add your custom branding and create another build. Download. Test. Customize. Rinse. Repeat.

## 2) Order buttons
To order physical buttons, you can visit our [Buy Page](https://beta.helpdeskbuttons.com/buy.php).
If you want custom buttons, we work with art you send us (we request a 2-color SVG) and we get that set up for print and production as well as preprogramming with a link to your most recent software build, which can be installed with a long (10s) button press. We also preprogram the Helpdesk Button-branded buttons with your build as well.

## 3) Deploy to all of your endpoints
We have a link to that aforementioned MSI as well as custom Powershell and Batch scripts for deploying on your [Builds page](https://beta.helpdeskbuttons.com/builds.php), Additionally we have some guides on how to deploy with some of the more popular RMM tools in the deployment section of the documents.  If you want additional assistance, we offer our welcome and service packages during which our development team can assist and complete all of this for you. These are also linked through the buy page, but you can visit the shop directly, here: [Welcome Packs](https://cms.helpdeskbuttons.com/product-category/starter-pack/).



## 4) Further customize and enjoy the extensibility of Helpdesk Buttons
We know that your business flow is going to differ from our hundreds of other clients, so we're constantly building out better methods for you to take the reins on what information is being collected and how close of an integration you'd like with your PSA. With each ticket submitted to you, you will receive the same excellent baseline of real-time diagnostics and annotated screenshots, but with our [Custom Scripts](/content/customization/custom-scripts) and [Custom Rules](/content/integration/advanced#custom-rules), you can better gather pertinent information, triage and process tickets before they've even hit your system.
