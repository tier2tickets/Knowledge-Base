Branding
========

The branding page has been overhauled and is simpler to use.

You can customize the appearance of the software by uploading a logo (400 x 125 pixel PNG) and/or an icon (256 x 256 pixel PNG).

If you donâ€™t have your images in the right format or size, we have used https://resizeimage.net/ and have been really happy with the results.

Make sure to `rebuild <https://account.helpdeskbuttons.com/builds.php>`_ your MSI after uploading.
