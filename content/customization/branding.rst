Branding
========

The branding page has been overhauled and is simpler to use.

You can customize the appearance of the software by uploading a logo (400 x 125 pixel PNG) and/or an icon (256 x 256 pixel PNG).

If you donâ€™t have your images in the right format or size, we have used https://resizeimage.net/ and have been really happy with the results.

Make sure to `rebuild <https://account.helpdeskbuttons.com/builds.php>`_ your MSI after uploading.

If you are looking for a way to change the name of the helpdesk button shortcut we reccomend the method in our documentation on 
`installations <https://docs.tier2tickets.com/content/general/installation/>`_ this method is used in our 
`deployment scripts <https://docs.tier2tickets.com/content/deployment/scripts/>`_.
