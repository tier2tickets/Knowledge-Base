Branding
========

The payload.zip file which you upload :ref:`custom scripts <content/customization/custom-scripts:Custom Scripts>` with is where you also upload your branding.

You can customize the appearance of the software by adding a banner (400 x 125 pixel PNG) and an icon (256 x 256 pixel PNG) to payload.zip.

To do so, create a file named icon.png which is exactly 256px x 256px and in PNG format. Then create a file named logo.png which is exactly 400px x 125px. Put them both in the root of your payload.zip file and upload the payload and `rebuild the MSI <https://account.helpdeskbuttons.com/builds.php>`_.

If you donâ€™t have your images in the right format or size, we have used https://resizeimage.net/ and have been really happy with the results.

Please note: YOU MUST PUT YOUR FILES IN THE ROOT of payload.zip and not in a subfolder.  This is very easy to do inadvertently.
