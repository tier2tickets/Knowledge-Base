BETA Loginwith.me
============================

To help fill in the gaps in modern RMM/PSA stacks, Tier2Technologies created an optional, lightning-fast Remote Access and Remote Terminal tool, Loginwith.me

This tool is built on Apache Guacamole and is 100% optional. 

This service can be toggled on or off on the `Remote Access Options page. <https://account.helpdeskbuttons.com/remote>`_

Loginwith.me will be both an attended and unattended remote access tool.  

When a user submits a ticket, the technician may access Loginwith.me by clicking on the "Connect to Device" button on the top right hand side of the Tier2Tickets report.
