BETA TechConnect
============================

To help fill in the gaps in modern RMM/PSA stacks, Tier2Technologies created an optional, lightning-fast Remote Access and Remote Terminal tool, TechConnect.

This tool is built on Apache Guacamole and is 100% optional. The connection only lasts up to 60 minutes, and only when the end user consents to the connection.

This service can be toggled on or off on the `Integration Settings page. <https://account.helpdeskbuttons.com/backend.php>`_

To access TechConnect, the service must be turned on before the user submits a ticket. 

When a user submits a ticket, the technician may access TechConnect by clicking on the "Connect to Device" button on the top right hand side of the Tier2Tickets report.
