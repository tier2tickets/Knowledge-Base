Remote Access Options
===============================

This page allows you to customize your remote access options.

Ethical Usage Agreement
--------------------------
To enable these options and the API, you will first have to accept our Ethical Usage Agreement. 
The agreement can be signed by anyone who has administrator permissions on the account. 

The page itself will prompt you to request an email from Hellosign. Check your email and sign the document via the link provided.
Once the document has been signed, you will get an email response. The page can then be reset to allow the use of these options.


Enable loginwith.me 
-----------------------
This will enable the loginwith.me integrations with Tier2Tickets once the feature is released.

Add Diagnostic Reports to Every ticket
----------------------------------------
When connected to a ticket system with webhooks, Tier2Tickets can be configured to append Diagnostic Reports on every ticket even if the ticket 
was not put in via Tier2Tickets software. The Diagnostic Report will not be exactly as the issue happened, but it will be as 
soon as the ticket system reports the ticket has been submitted. 

Device Management vs Diagnostic Report
--------------------------------------------
There are two main access points for these remote features, Diagnostic Reports and the Device Management Page. 
You can toggle adding each feature for each point of access.
